# Collectibles Web
Website created as the final project for the University of Pittsburgh's
intermediate Web Development course, CS 334

***

In case the site is no longer available sometime in the future, the basic
feature set is pretty simple.

- Register users
- Log them in
- Add new "collectibles" to the site
- View them
- Search for them
- Edit them

That's pretty much it.
